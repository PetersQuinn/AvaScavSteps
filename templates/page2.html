            What is love without emotional safety?
            The anchor is the foundation of any relationship, a place where you feel secure and understood.
            It's where you can be yourself, free from judgment and doubt.
            The anchor is the heart of the connection, a bond that holds everything together.
            I want you to remember that feeling, that sense of safety and trust.
